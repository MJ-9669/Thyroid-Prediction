# Thyroid-Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the detection of thyroid disorders using machine learning techniques. By leveraging advanced data analytics, the goal is to create an efficient and reliable model to assist healthcare professionals in early and accurate identification of thyroid conditions.

## Dataset

The project uses a publicly available thyroid disorder dataset from Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository:
* Samples: 9,172
* Features: 31 (including patient demographics, medical history, and lab test results)

## Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:
  * Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
  * Removed columns with excessive missing data and managed outliers to ensure data quality.
  * Encoded categorical variables to numerical format.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Visualized the distribution of features.
  * Examined relationships between age, gender, and thyroid hormone levels.
  * Identified trends and correlations within the dataset.

3. Model Development:
  * Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
  * Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio).
  * Achieved high training accuracy (96.4%) and testing accuracy (94.3%).

4. Evaluation:
  * Analyzed the model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
  * Constructed a confusion matrix to identify misclassifications and areas for model improvement.

## Results

1. Performance:
* Training accuracy: 96.4%
* Testing accuracy: 94.3%
* Minimal prediction errors, indicated by low MSE and RMSE values.

2. Insights:
* The model performed well overall, with most accurate predictions in the "Negative" class.
* Highlighted areas for improvement in distinguishing between "Hyperthyroid" and "Hypothyroid" cases.


## Future Work

* Further fine-tuning of the model to improve classification of specific thyroid disorders.
* Exploration of other machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.

## How to Run

* Clone the repository.

* Install the necessary Python libraries using requirements.txt.

* Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to detecting thyroid disorders using machine learning, showing potential for aiding healthcare professionals in timely diagnoses and treatment.
